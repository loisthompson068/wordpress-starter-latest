# WP Starter Configuration

**WP Starter can work without any setup at all**, however one of its greatest features is its flexibility that allows for fine grained customization of every aspect according to the project requirements.



## Configuration in `composer.json`

Like other Composer plugins, WP Starter configuration goes into `extra` section of `composer.json`.

More specifically, it goes into a sub-object `wpstarter` in the  `extra` section.

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "wpstarter": {
            "config-name": "config value"
        }
    }
}
```



## Configuration in  `wpstarter.json` 

For better readability and portability it is also possible to have a file named **`wpstarter.json`**, placed besides `composer.json`, that contains only WP Starter configuration (anything that would go in the  `extra.wpstarter` object):

```json
{
    "config-name": "config value"
}
```

WP Starter will recognize the file and will load configuration from there, without the need to have anything set in  `composer.json` or anywhere else.



## Configuration in a custom file

Instead of using a file named `wpstarter.json` in root folder it is also possible to tell WP Starter to use a different file to load configuration.

A use case could be to reuse the same WP Starter configuration for many websites that resides under the same parent folder.

To do this, in  `composer.json` it is necessary to use the `extra.wpstarter` configuration to set the path of the custom file. The path must be relative to the folder containing the `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "wpstarter": "../wpstarter-shared-config.json"
    }
}
```

This also enables to have the configuration file available in a custom Composer package and make it available to WP Starter by pointing to the file in vendor folder:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "wpstarter": "./vendor/my-company/wp-starter-shared/config.json"
    }
}
```



## Configuration precedence


The values in `wpstarter.json` takes precedence when  composer.json contains an `extra.wpstarter` section  (regardless if as an object or as a path to a custom file) with duplicate values to the `wpstarter.json`.



## Generic configuration

There are two configuration values that affect WP Starter that **cannot** be placed inside the `extra.wpstarter` object, nor can they be set in `wpstarter.json`:

- `"wordpress-install-dir"`
- `"wordpress-content-dir"`

These two configuration values might contain a custom path where to place, respectively, WordPress core files and WordPress "content packages": plugin, themes, MU plugins, and dropins.

`"wordpress-install-dir"` is not even a WP Starter specific configuration, but it comes from the WordPress core installer. Regardless of whether the Wordpress core installer is used, this configuration is required to tell WP Starter where WordPress core files are located.

This configuration defaults to `"./wordpress"` meaning a `wordpress` folder inside project root.

`"wordpress-content-dir"` has been introduced by WP Starter and it is located differently from other WP Starter settings to be in symmetry with `"wordpress-install-dir"`.

This configuration defaults to `"./wp-content"` meaning a `wp-content` folder inside project root.
