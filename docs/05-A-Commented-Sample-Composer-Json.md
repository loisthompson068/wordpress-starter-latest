# A Commented Sample `composer.json`

Below thereâ€™s a sample `composer.json` not very different from what can be used in real world for a WP Starter powered website:

```json
{
  "name": "my-company/my-project",
  "type": "project",
  "license": "proprietary",
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "composer",
      "url": "https://wpackagist.org"
    }
  ],
  "require": {
    "composer/installers": "^1.6",
    "wecodemore/wpstarter": "^3",
    "johnpbloch/wordpress": "4.9",
    "inpsyde/wonolog":"^1",
    "wpackagist-plugin/wordfence":">=7.1.14",
    "wpackagist-plugin/memcached":"3.0.*",
    "frc/batcache": "1.3.*"
  },
  "extra": {
    "wordpress-install-dir": "public/wp",
    "wordpress-content-dir": "public/wp-content",
    "installer-paths":       {
      "public/wp-content/plugins/{$name}": [
        "type:wordpress-plugin"
      ],
      "public/wp-content/mu-plugins/{$name}": [
        "type:wordpress-muplugin"
      ],
      "public/wp-content/themes/{$name}": [
        "type:wordpress-theme"
      ],
      "public/wp-content/{$name}": [
        "type:wordpress-dropin"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For readability sake, WP Starter specific configuration will be placed in separate `wpstarter.json` file that could look like this:

```json
{
  "register-theme-folder": true,
  "content-dev-dir": "./",
  "dropins": [
    "./public/wp-content/plugins/memcached/object-cache.php",
    "./public/wp-content/mu-plugins/batcache/advanced-cache.php"
  ],
  "wp-cli-commands": "./scripts/wp-cli-commands.php"
}
```

But the exact same configuration could have been placed in a **`extra.wpstarter`** object in `composer.json` with exact same result.



## Configuration step by step

For the `composer.json` itself, `"name"`, "type", and `"license"` are quite basic and nothing that is specific to WP Starter. Please refer to [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) if not familiar with it. 

### Repositories

In the sample `composer.json` we used [`"repositories"`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md) setting to tell Composer to use [WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org/). This is a free Composer repository (maintained by [Outlandish](http://outlandish.com/) that exposes plugins and themes available on the official [wp.org](https://wordpress.org/) repository as Composer packages.

The official Composer repository, [Packagist](https://packagist.org/), is already checked by Composer, so there's no need to add it.

### Require

[`require`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#the-require-key) section of  `composer.json` is where we tell Composer what packages we need, and in which version.

[**`"composer/installers"`**](http://composer.github.io/installers/) is a library that provides custom installers for project-specific files. In our case, this will make possible for WordPress plugin and themes to be placed in the WP content folder instead of in the standard "vendor" directory.

**`"wecodemore/wpstarter"`** is the present package.

The two above are the only two required packages to have a WP Starter powered website.

[**`"johnpbloch/wordpress"`**](https://packagist.org/packages/johnpbloch/wordpress) is the unofficial WordPress package maintained by [John P. Bloch](https://johnpbloch.com/). Even if this is not required, not is the only way to put WordPress core on the project, this is by far the more common way (with its 2.5M+ downloads) to deal with core installations in projects managed by Composer.

[**`"inpsyde/wonolog"`**](https://inpsyde.github.io/Wonolog/) is just an example of a library (not a plugin) that we might want to add to our website. Because it is available on Packagist we just add it to requirements... and that's it. It depends on other dependencies, who maybe depends on other... Composer will recursively discover the dependencies and install everything for us.

[**`"wpackagist-plugin/wordfence"`**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/) is an example of a plugin we might want to add to our website. This plugin does not support Composer. But we can require it via *WordPress Packagist*, because we have included that in our  `"repositories"` setting.

[**"wpackagist-plugin/memcached"**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/memcached/) is another plugin that we can add via *WordPress Packagist*. This is been added here as example of a special case. In fact, this plugin is not really a plugin, but a **dropin**. By reading [install instruction](https://wordpress.org/plugins/memcached/#installation) they say *"Copy object-cache.php to wp-content"*, but WP Starter can do that for us, we'll see soon how.

[**`"frc/batcache"`**](https://packagist.org/packages/frc/batcache) is a plugin that is available on Packagist, so it is easily required. However, it represents another special case. Looking at its [source](https://github.com/frc/batcache) it contains both a **MU plugin** ([`batcache.php`](https://github.com/frc/batcache/blob/frc/batcache.php)) plus a **dropin** ([`advanced-cache.php`](https://github.com/frc/batcache/blob/frc/advanced-cache.php)). We well see how with a very minimum configuration WP Starter will handle it perfectly, placing everything in the right place without any manual intervention nor custom scripts.

### Extra

`extra` is the `composer.json` that Composer reserves for Composer plugins configuration. And it is exactly what we are doing there: providing configuration for the 3 plugins we have:

- WP core installer
- WP Starter
- Composer installers

#### WP core installer configuration

WP core installer is an "installer plugin". It tells Composer where to place the packages of type `"wordpress-core"` that are not supported by Composer installers. By default the plugin tells composer to install WordPress in the `./wordpress` directory and provides the **`extra.wordpress-install-dir`** to customize it.

In our sample, we are telling to place WP in the folder `public/wp`, because having a "public" folder will enable us to use that as webroot and place the `.env` file in the root of the project, so outside of webroot.

#### WP content configuration

WP content folder, is *indirectly* defined by the setting we use for plugin and themes via `"extra.installer-paths"` path (more on this below). E.g. if we tell Composer to put plugins in `./wp-content/plugins` we are *implying* that `./wp-content` is the contend folder.

However, WP Starter needs the content folder to be explicitly declared so that it can perform different tasks ("development content" step, dropins step, and so on).

The way we inform WP Starter about the location of WP content folder is  **`extra.wordpress-content-dir`** setting that is designed to be symmetrical to `wordpress-install-dir` and so placed outside `extra.wpstarter` that is where all the other WP Starter configurations resides.

#### Composer installers configuration

We are requiring Composer installers to allow plugins, themes, MU plugins, and dropins to be placed inside WP content folder instead of default vendor folder.

By default this plugins tells Composer to place those types of packages in the `/wp-content` folder (hardcoded) in the root folder.

However, that does not work for us: both because as described above we are customizing the content folder (placing it outside of WP core folder) and we are also customizing WP core folder.

Luckily, Composer installers supports configuration via the **`"extra.installer-paths"`** entry. See [documentation](https://github.com/composer/installers#custom-install-paths).

Basically, with our configuration, we are telling Composer installers to place:

- packages of type `"wordpress-plugin"` in the folder `./public/wp-content/plugins/{$name}/`, where name is the package *name*, e.g. *"wordfence"* if we are requiring `wpackagist-plugin/wordfence` *("wpackagist-plugin"* is the *vendor*);
- packages of type  `"wordpress-muplugin"` in the folder `./public/wp-content/muplugins/{$name}/`;
- packages of type `"wordpress-theme"` in the folder `./public/wp-content/themes/{$name}/`
- packages of type `"wordpress-dropin"` in the folder `./public/wp-content/{$name}/`

It is worth nothing that even while this setup works for plugins and themes, which are recognized in subfolders of  `wp-content/plugins` and `wp-content/themes` respectively, it does **not** work out of the box for MU plugins and dropins: MU plugins needs to be *directly* inside  `wp-content/mu-plugins` (no subfolders) and dropins needs to be  *directly* inside `wp-content`.

WP Starter handle this for us. The `MuLoaderStep` takes care of creating a "loader" responsible to load MU plugins from subfolders of `wp-content/mu-plugins` and the `DropinsStep` take care of moving the dropin files directly into `wp-content`.

However, this is not working for `"wpackagist-plugin/memcached"` because this is a dropin, even if its type says `"wordpress-plugin"` (due to the automatism of WordPress Packagist and to the fact the official repository only supports plugins and themes and not MU plugins nor dropins). We will see hot to fix this with a single line of configuration in our `wpstarter.json`.

Moreover, is is _partially_ working for `"frc/batcache"`, in fact this package contains both a MU plugin and a dropin, and its package type says `"wordpress-muplugin"`, which means that for the provided  MU plugin, we are setup, but for the dropin, we need another line of configuration in our `wpstarter.json`.



## WP Starter specific configuration

 **`"extra.wpsrtarter"`** is the place for all the WP Starter configuration. However, WP Starter supports also a separate **`wpstarter.json`** file located at project root, and that is what we are using in our sample.

The chapter *"Configuration"* has a "cheat sheet" of all the available settings.

Below there is the a step by step explanation of only the configuration used in the sample `wpstarter.json`. we are using here  The rest of configuration is quite well documented in the *"Configuration"* chapter itself and in the *"WP Starter Steps"* chapter that describes all the configurations that affect each single step.

### `register-theme-folder`

In our `require` sample there are no themes. Even if we are using the WordPress package that ships with default (Twenty*) themes, our installation would not *see* those, because we are using a different WP content folder. WordPress has a function, [`register_theme_directory`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_theme_directory/) that can be used to tell WordPress to look for themes in a custom folder (additionally to the default theme folder).

When the `register-theme-folder` setting is set to `true`, like in our sample, the `wp-config.php` will contain a call to that function, that will register the default themes folder, so that WordPress can find it and we don't need to install any theme if we are ok using one of the default ones.

### `content-dev-dir`

*"WP Starter Steps"* chapter has a detailed explanation of what "development content" means in WP Starter.

Basically, those are themes, plugins, MU plugins, and dropins that are placed in the same repository of the project, but are kept outside of WP content directory because that contains 3rd party dependencies and having those in separate folder makes VCS handling easier.

By default WP Starter expects those files and folders to be placed in a `./content-dev` folder inside root. By setting `content-dev-dir` to `"./"` we are telling WP Starter that the "development content" parent folder is project root.

Which means, for example, that any plugin files and folders inside `./plugins` will be symlinked at `./public/wp-content/plugins` where WordPress will found them. Same goes for themes, MU plugins and dropins.

### `dropins`

It has been said already how the package  `"wpackagist-plugin/memcached"`  we are requiring, having the type `"wordpress-plugin"` will be placed in the folder `./public/wp-content/plugins/memcached/`. However, what that package actually contains is a dropin that should be moved directly into ``./public/wp-content/`.

It has also been said how the package `"frc/batcache"`, whose type is `"wordpress-muplugin"` will be placed in `./public/wp-content/mu-plugins/batcache/` and that works for the MU plugin it actually ships (thanks to the loader WP Starter automatically creates) but not for the dropin the package also provides.

The `dropins` settings is an array of dropin files paths that WP Starter has to place in the proper folder. By simply listing the source paths WP Starter will know what to do, and everything will be setup without any additional script or manual intervention.

### `wp-cli-commands`

There's an entire documentation chapter, *"Running WP CLI Commands",* that explains the ins and outs of running WP CLI commands via WP Starter (and why it might be worth to do it) .

So we are not going to explain the purpose of `wp-cli-commands` again here, we can just that the file located at `./scripts/wp-cli-commands.php` will return an array of commands for WP CLI that can be used to install the WordPress database or something along those lines.



## A look at the folder structure

By looking at the sample `composer.json` above, we can guess what could be a possible folder structure of the project _before_ Composer and WP Starter run.

Something like this:

```
\.
 |_ mu-plugins/
     |_ my-project-mu-plugin.php
 |_ scripts/
     |_ wp-cli-commands.php
 |_ composer.json
 |_ wpstarter.json
 |_ .env
 |_ .gitignore
```

_After_ we run `composer update` the structure will be something like this:

```
\.
 |_ mu-plugins/
     |_ my-project-mu-plugin.php
 |_ public/
     |_ wp/
         |_ wp-admin/
             |_ index.php
             |...
         |_ wp-includes/
             |_ wp-db.php
             |...
         |_ wp-content/
             |_ themes/
                 |_ twentyfifteen/
                     |...
                 |_ twentyseventeen/
                     |...
                 |_ twentysixteen/
                     |...
                 |_ index.php
             |_ plugins/
                 |_ akismet/
                     |...
                 |_ hello.php
                 |_ index.php
             |_ index.php
         |_ composer.json
         |_ index.php
         |_ wp-config-sample.php
         |_ wp-load.php
         |_ wp-login.php
         |_ wp-settings.php
         |...
     |_ wp-content/
         |_ mu-plugins/
             |_ batcache/
                 |_ batcache.php
                 |...
             |->> my-project-mu-plugin.php   // symlink
             |_ wpstarter-mu-loader.php
         |_ plugins/
             |_ wordfence/
                 |_ wordfence.php
                 |_ index.php
                 |...
         |_ themes/
         |_ advanced-cache.php
         |_ object-cache.php
     |_ index.php
     |_ wp-config.php
 |_ scripts/
     |_ wp-cli-commands.php
 |_ vendor/
     |...
 |_ composer.json
 |_ wpstarter.json
 |_ .env
 |_ .gitignore
```

If webroot is pointing correctly to `./public` and `.env` contains the necessary configuration, then there's nothing else we need to do to make it work.
